# Future input features from real timestamps (planning only — needs a new dataset export)

**Context (Andrew + Claude, 2026-07-15).** anki-revlogs-10k is anonymized: `day_offset`
integer days only, re-indexed IDs. In real Anki, `card_id` / `note_id` / `deck_id` /
`review_id` are all **epoch-millisecond creation/review timestamps**, so a fresh export that
preserves them unlocks the features below. This breaks the current 92-dim input invariant →
a **future data-side phase**, not something to A/B on the current LMDBs. Deploy-side cost is
~zero (Anki has the real IDs at inference). Cross-checked against the existing 92-dim feature
table — [`INPUT_FEATURES.md`](../INPUT_FEATURES.md) at the repo root — so we don't re-add what
exists; the `#N` references below are its row numbers.

## Already covered by existing features — do NOT re-add
- Workload today: #14 (new cards today), #15 (reviews today).
- Since this card's last review: #12/#13 (new cards / reviews in between).
- Cross-card recency at day granularity: #10 (days since any review).
- Sub-day phases of this card's own clock: #4/#6.
- Cyclic calendar structure at 3/7/30/100/365/3650/36500 d: #11 + #22–28 — but
  **pseudo-phase** (anchored to day_offset, arbitrary per user).

## Candidate new features (consolidated after Andrew's cross-check)
| Priority | Feature | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| high | Time-of-day: raw sin/cos of the 24 h phase, plus **user-relative deviation from a running *circular mean*** (per-user state = 2 floats: S += sin θ, C += cos θ over all prior reviews; usual hour = atan2(S,C)) | Andrew's #1; sidesteps the unknown-timezone problem (a timezone = constant phase offset, cancels in the deviation). Circular mean replaces the original "median hour" idea (Andrew's efficiency concern 2026-07-16): O(1)/review, 8 B/user, and circular-correct where a median breaks for around-midnight reviewers. Plain running mean, NO decay (Andrew 2026-07-16: EMA not needed). Fallback worth A/B-ing: raw phase only — the recurrent user stream can learn "usual hour" internally. |
| high | **Real-phase** calendar cycles (true day-of-week/month/year/decade, sin/cos) | Andrew's #2; upgrades #11/#22–28 from pseudo- to true phase → shared weekend/holiday effects across users. Weekend/weekday binary as the cheap special case (👍). |
| high | First review − card creation | Andrew's #3; completes card age: #2/#5 count from FIRST REVIEW, this covers creation→first-review. |
| high | Seconds-resolution "time since any review" (session position) | #10 is integer-day (built from day_offset) → sub-day session structure is invisible today. Continuous gap ≫ arbitrary session-split heuristics. |
| med | Creation-batch size at ±1 min / ±1 h / same day (+ position in batch) | Andrew's #4 generalized; import-vs-handmade signal. Andrew 👍 |
| med | User tenure (time since user's first-ever review) | Confirmed NOT in the table. |
| med | note_id/deck_id/preset_id ages: card − deck creation, card - preset creation, deck age at review, preset age at review | Early core card vs late addition; preset ids are creation timestamps too (Andrew 2026-07-16: use both). ⚠ the DEFAULT deck and DEFAULT preset both have id 1 (constant, not a timestamp) — derive an is-default flag for those instead of an age. Andrew 👍 |
| low | Card created before vs after user's first-ever review | "Probably not important, but we can try" (Andrew). |
| skip | card_id − note_id gap | ~always zero (cards generated at note creation) — not worth a dim. |
| skip | Session count per day | Splitting is arbitrary; the sub-day #10 upgrade carries the signal continuously. |

## Leakage rule
All count/batch features must be computed **as of review time** during preprocessing (not from
the full table) so same-day-created-and-reviewed cards stay honest.
